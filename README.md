# Aircraft Engine Health Monitoring using CMAPSS

This project uses NASA's CMAPSS FD001 dataset to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines using machine learning.

## Structure
- `src/`: All source code for preprocessing and modeling
- `data/`: Raw dataset (FD001.txt)
- `models/`: Trained model files
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and plotting

## Run
```bash
python main.py
```
